### **Part 1: The Lived Experience (Impact)**

*Goal: To capture the raw reality of the disaster.*

**1. "Can you walk me through your experience during the last major flood? How did the event unfold for you and your family from start to finish?"** *(Look for: The timeline of events and the emotional state.)*

**2. "Beyond the immediate damage to roads or buildings, how did the flood affect your livelihood and daily routine in the weeks that followed?"** *(Look for: Hidden impacts like lost wages, inability to reach hospitals, or children missing school.)*

**3. "When the water started rising, what was the specific moment or sign that made you realize, 'This is dangerous, we need to move'?**" *(Look for: Was it the sound of the river? A phone call? Seeing a neighbor run? This helps you understand their "Trigger Point".)*

### **Part 2: The Information Gap (Current Systems)**

*Goal: To find out why the current technology is failing them.*

**4. "Think back to the hours before the flood hit. What information did you have at that time, and where did it come from?"** *(Look for: Reliable sources vs. Rumors. Did they get a WhatsApp forward? A government siren? Nothing?)*

**5. "Many people say they ignore standard weather alerts. How do you decide if a warning is serious enough to actually evacuate or take action?"** *(Look for: The "Trust Gap." Do they need to see rain first? Do they wait for an elder to decide?)*

**6. "If you received official warnings in the past, was there anything confusing or missing in those messages that made it hard for you to act?"** *(Look for: Language barriers, technical jargon like "mm of rain" which they might not visualize.)*

**7. "In a crisis, who is the one person or group in this community that everyone listens to and trusts the most?"** *(Look for: The "Influencer"—is it the Temple Priest, the Pradhan, or the local youth club? Your system needs to target this person.)*

### **Part 3: Co-Designing the Solution (Future Needs)**

*Goal: To let them design the solution for you.*

**8. "If you could design the perfect warning system for this specific village, what would it look like or sound like?"** *(Look for: Specific requests like "A siren at the temple" or "A phone call in the local dialect".)*

**9. "We are trying to build a system where the community helps the computer. How willing would you be to report water levels using your phone, and what would make that easy for you to do?"** *(Look for: Motivation. Would they do it for free? Do they need a simple button?)*

**10. "Looking back, what is the one piece of information or one resource you wish you had possessed 24 hours before the flood hit?"** *(Look for: The "Golden Insight"—this answer often defines the core feature of your project.)*
